        "Dear Students and Faculty Members"

"\n\nWelcome back to Gangtok. Hope you enjoyed your winter vacation.Some of you would have spent part of the vacation on study tour, fieldwork, internship, national service, etc. while others would have spent time with friends and family members." "\n\nI am sure you have come back energized and empowered with new knowledge and experience to share with others."

"\n\nAs I welcome you all, I would like to particularly remind the final semester students that this is your last semester. As such, make the best of the remaining days in hand." "\n\nYou are supposed to be mentored by your teachers during this semester.Hope they are taking care of your intellectual and emotional needs, answering your queries with empathy, and preparing you for the challenging life outside the university.You are lucky to have highly dedicated teachers, although every one of them may not live up to your expectations."

"\n\nFor the teachers I have charted a huge responsibility in the current semester.First of all I would like you all to give your one hour every week to the weaker among your student.You can do this without making them feel inferior.All of them were not rich or lucky enough to go to good schools and colleges, and hence generally perform better in your class.Secondly, I would like you to mentor the final semester students, prepare them for the challenges coming their way in the months and years to come.If you do that they will ever remember you and be grateful to you." "\n\nFinally, we are embarking on a round of major revision of our curriculum. We wish to make our curriculum helpful to our students in cracking various competitive exams as well as cracking the mysteries of life. We also wish to start some add-on certificate courses from the Odd Semester this year, which would help our students face the job market with one extra qualification in hand. All this is not easy to achieve without the cooperation of every faculty member of the university, but I know you will come forward to do all this for the sake of your students even if it is at times challenging for yourselves."

"\n\nA very happy 2017 to you all\n\n"

        "Introduction to SU NSS Cell.\n\n"

        "Sikkim University  NSS Cell was initiated on January 8th, 2014 and  registered to the Regional Centre, Gangtok i.e. Dept. of Sports and Youth Affairs, Govt. of Sikkim with sanction of three units in the month of March, 2015.\n"  "\nThe in-charge of NSS Cell  is Programme Coordinator appointed by Hon’ble Vice-Chancellor for a period of three years and presently the position  is held by Dr. Sujata Upadhyay, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Horticulture.   Dr. Subhash Mishra, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Education, Dr. Jigmie W. Bhutia, Assistant Professor, Dept. of Tourism and Dr. Namrata, Dept. of Psychology are serving as Programme Officers of NSS.\n" "\nThe Cell has a formally constituted Advisory Board headed by the Hon’ble Vice-Chancellor as its Chief Patron. The Cell has three registered units i.e. 300 enrolled student volunteers presently.  The Cell is also supported by participations from faculty members and administrative staff members of the University. It is engaged in social activities in and around Gangtok in the State of Sikkim. It organizes regular activities or programmes in a year in the form of orientation/personality development workshops, blood donation camp, plantation programmes, cleaning drive, health awareness etc. The fifty per cent students of a unit participate in Special Camps organized once in a year on a certain theme.\n\n"
        "The Cell has organized/participated in  various programmes e.g. Orientation programme, “Swachchha Bharat Abhiyaan (cleaning drive and field visits)”,  “Green Walk”, Blood donation camp, “Sikkim Run”, “National Youth Festival (Guwahati)”, “Bharatiya Chhatra Sansad (Pune)”, Training programme on “Solid Waste Management” at IIT, Guwahati, Special Camp on “Creation of Sanitation Awareness”, TCS Employability training programme, Workshop on “Holistic Personality Development of Students”, various speech, debate, essay competitions etc.\n\n"
        "The NSS activities are exclusively funded by the Ministry of Sports and Youth Affairs, Govt. of India, hence no fee is charged from the members.  The scheme is designed in such a manner so as to involve as many students of University in various social activities and encourage them to become ideal citizens of the country. As in most of the institutions, NSS volunteers in Sikkim University are not required to put on uniform but wearing of NSS badge in its  programmes is mandatory. The Cell provides certificates to the participating volunteers on completion of a minimum of 240 hours of regular activities and a special camp in a duration of two years. The certificate has significant value in co-curricular activities in the academic career of students. \n\n"
        "How to apply:\n"
"All students admitted in the University are free to apply for NSS membership. Application in the prescribed format may be submitted to the NSS Cell in the beginning of Monsoon Semester during the month of August and the notice regarding enrollment is circulated by NSS Cell every year mentioning vacancy and other details.\n"

"\nContact details: Dr. Sujata Upadhyay (8967036279), Dr. Subhash Misra (9474032624)\n"
        "\nNSS Motto-
The motto or watchword of the National Service Scheme is : ‘NOT ME BUT YOU’. This reflects the essence of democratic living and upholds the need for selfless service and appreciation of the other person’s point of view and also to show consideration for fellow human beings. It underlines that the welfare of an individual is ultimately dependent on the welfare of society on the whole. Therefore, it should be the aim of the NSS to demonstrate this motto in its day-to-day programme.
\nNSS Symbol-
The symbol of the National Service Scheme, as appearing on the cover page of this Manual is based on the ‘Rath’ wheel of the Konark Sun Temple situated in Orissa. These giant wheels of the Sun Temple portray the cycle of creation, preservation and release and signify the movement in life across time and space. The design of the symbol, a simplified form of the Sun-chariot wheel primarily depicts movement. The wheel signifies the progressive cycle of life. It stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social transformation and upliftment.
\nNSS Badge-
The NSS symbol is embossed on the NSS badge. The NSS volunteers wear it while undertaking any programme of community service. The Konark wheel in the symbol has eight bars which represent the 24 hours of the day. Hence, the badge reminds the wearer to be in readiness for service of the nation round the clock i.e. for 24 hours. The red colour in the badge indicates that the NSS volunteers are full of blood i.e. lively, active, energetic and full of high spirit. The navy blue colour indicates the cosmos of which the NSS is a tiny part, ready to contribute its share for the welfare of the mankind.
\nNSS Day-
NSS was formally launched on 24th September, 1969, the birth centenary year of the Father of the Nation. Therefore, 24 September is celebrated every year as NSS Day with appropriate programmes and activities.
\nNSS Song-
During Silver Jubilee Year the NSS theme song had been composed. All NSS volunteers are expected to learn the theme song and sing the song during NSS programmes and celebrations. "

        "Material is the metaphor.\n\n"

        "A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space and a system of motion."
        "The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet "
        "technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.\n"
        "Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are grounded in reality. The "
        "use of familiar tactile attributes helps users quickly understand affordances. Yet the "
        "flexibility of the material creates new affordances that supercede those in the physical "
        "world, without breaking the rules of physics.\n"
        "The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to conveying how objects move, "
        "interact, and exist in space and in relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows "
        "seams, divides space, and indicates moving parts.\n\n"

        "Bold, graphic, intentional.\n\n"

        "The foundational elements of print based design typography, grids, space, scale, color, "
        "and use of imagery guide visual treatments. These elements do far more than please the "
        "eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and focus. Deliberate color choices, edge to edge "
        "imagery, large scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic "
        "interface that immerse the user in the experience.\n"
        "An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately apparent and provides "
        "waypoints for the user.\n\n"

        "Motion provides meaning.\n\n"

        "Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover. Primary user actions are "
        "inflection points that initiate motion, transforming the whole design.\n"
        "All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without "
        "breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize.\n"
        "Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity. "
        "Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are efﬁcient yet coherent.\n\n"

        "3D world.\n\n"

        "The material environment is a 3D space, which means all objects have x, y, and z "
        "dimensions. The z-axis is perpendicularly aligned to the plane of the display, with the "
        "positive z-axis extending towards the viewer. Every sheet of material occupies a single "
        "position along the z-axis and has a standard 1dp thickness.\n"
        "On the web, the z-axis is used for layering and not for perspective. The 3D world is "
        "emulated by manipulating the y-axis.\n\n"

        "Light and shadow.\n\n"

        "Within the material environment, virtual lights illuminate the scene. Key lights create "
        "directional shadows, while ambient light creates soft shadows from all angles.\n"
        "Shadows in the material environment are cast by these two light sources. In Android "
        "development, shadows occur when light sources are blocked by sheets of material at "
        "various positions along the z-axis. On the web, shadows are depicted by manipulating the "
        "y-axis only. The following example shows the card with a height of 6dp.\n\n"

        "Resting elevation.\n\n"

        "All material objects, regardless of size, have a resting elevation, or default elevation "
        "that does not change. If an object changes elevation, it should return to its resting "
        "elevation as soon as possible.\n\n"

        "Component elevations.\n\n"

        "The resting elevation for a component type is consistent across apps (e.g., FAB elevation "
        "does not vary from 6dp in one app to 16dp in another app).\n"
        "Components may have different resting elevations across platforms, depending on the depth "
        "of the environment (e.g., TV has a greater depth than mobile or desktop).\n\n"

        "Responsive elevation and dynamic elevation offsets.\n\n"

        "Some component types have responsive elevation, meaning they change elevation in response "
        "to user input (e.g., normal, focused, and pressed) or system events. These elevation "
        "changes are consistently implemented using dynamic elevation offsets.\n"
        "Dynamic elevation offsets are the goal elevation that a component moves towards, relative "
        "to the component’s resting state. They ensure that elevation changes are consistent "
        "across actions and component types. For example, all components that lift on press have "
        "the same elevation change relative to their resting elevation.\n"
        "Once the input event is completed or cancelled, the component will return to its resting "
        "elevation.\n\n"

        "Avoiding elevation interference.\n\n"

        "Components with responsive elevations may encounter other components as they move between "
        "their resting elevations and dynamic elevation offsets. Because material cannot pass "
        "through other material, components avoid interfering with one another any number of ways, "
        "whether on a per component basis or using the entire app layout.\n"
        "On a component level, components can move or be removed before they cause interference. "
        "For example, a floating action button (FAB) can disappear or move off screen before a "
        "user picks up a card, or it can move if a snackbar appears.\n"
        "On the layout level, design your app layout to minimize opportunities for interference. "
        "For example, position the FAB to one side of stream of a cards so the FAB won’t interfere "
        "when a user tries to pick up one of cards.\n\n"
